This here a simple web based user-friendly software designed to assist individuals in generating personalised business ideas, plans, and get information about the business industry, the minimum capital required and so on.
The web based mobile responsive software was built with NEXTJs for the frontend, Node + ExpressJs for the backend, PostGres Database for the database and OpenAI’s free API was integrated to as the MAN (Artificial Intelligence) behind the generation of the business details.
